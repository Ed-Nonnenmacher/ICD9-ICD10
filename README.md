# ICD9-ICD10
ICD mapping between 9 and 10
This project contains a few different ways to map ICD9 to ICD10 codes.
This is done through forward mapping, backward mapping, forward-backward mapping, and secondary mapping.

This comes as a:
  Class to separate tools used to parse data from actual mapping methods.
  Multiple functions for quick simple function calling, and less aggressive mapping techniques.
 
Please re-routeboth I9_Path and I10_Path to your corresponding file system.
